<p style="text-align:justify;">This project is based on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data/">Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset</a> in which there are several clinical parameters and we need to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease. For this we want to try to reach for an accuracy over 95% by trying different models.
<br><br>  
An initial exploration of the data will be done to see if we can find any patterns. Also, a correlation matrix is created to see how related each variable is to the others.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we have an intuition of the dataset, we will try three different models <i>Logistic Regression</i>, <i>K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier</i> and <i>Random Forest Classifier</i> and check which one performs better. After knowing the results, we will do some hyperparameter tuning to check if the models can improve further. Then we evaluate each of them and select the one that performs best and obtain some cross-validated classification metrics. Finally we study the Feature Importance to see which ones contribute more to the model.</p>

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github-View%20on%20Github-violet?logo=github)](https://github.com/germgallardo/Bulldozer-Price-Prediction)

<p style="text-align:justify;">This project is based on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview">Kaggle Competition for a Blue Book for Bulldozers</a> in which we have to predict the sale price of bulldozers given it's characteristics.
<br><br>
First we perform an EDA to understand important variables, then we enrich our dataset by doing feature engineering and finally we handled the missing values. Then by using <i>Random Forest Regressor</i> model and some hyperparameter tuning we predict the sale price for the bulldozers.</p>

My best model achieved in the validation set:
* Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) of 0.25120.
* Coefficient of Determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.87156.
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 6088.833.
