### ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Classification using Python and Scikit-Learn  
(https://github.com/germgallardo/Heart-Disease)

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is based on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data/">Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset</a> in which there are several clinical parameters and we need to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease. For this we want to try to reach for an accuracy over 95% by trying different models.<br>  
  
An initial exploration of the data will be done to see if we can find any patterns. Also, a correlation matrix is created to see how related each variable is to the others.</p>

| Once we have an intuition of the dataset, we will try three different models `Logistic Regression`, `K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier` and `Random Forest Classifier` and check which one performs better. After knowing the results, we will do some hyperparameter tuning to check if the models can improve further. | <img align="right" width="1000" height="400" src="/images/model_comparison2.png?raw=true"/> |
| After evaluating all the models, we select the one that performs best and obtain some cross-validated classification metrics. Finally we study the Feature Importance to see which ones contribute more to the model. | <img align="right" width="1000" height="400" src="/images/model_results_2.png?raw=true"/> |
